## Election Audit Summary
- This script can be modified to analyze the outcomes of any election, so long as the csv files that store the raw data are formatted properly. This is a general script that can calculate vote totals and percentages of different candidates, counties, states, etc. using basic Python tools and functions. The same principles applied in this script can be applied to any election in different Congressional districts in Colorado or even the United States. This script can be modified to calculate more things, such as how different demographics voted, how the turnout compared to other Congressional districts, on the condition the raw data for this information was available to the programmer.
